# ARENAS 
## Working package 2: Characterization and detection of extremist narratives
![My Project](https://github.com/rayaneghilene/ARENAS/blob/main/DSML_Research_Project/Images/Arenas-final-GIF.gif)


## Objective
The objective of ARENAS is to characterize, measure, and understand the role of extremist narratives in discourses that have an impact not only on political and social spheres but importantly on the stakeholders themselves.â€¯ Leading an innovative and ambitious research program, ARENAS will significantly contribute to filling the gap in contemporary research, make recommendations to policymakers, media, lawyers, social inclusion professionals, and educational institutions, and propose solutions for countering extreme narratives for developing more inclusive and respectful European societies.

This research project will be conducted in collaboration with some members
of the  [ARENAS European project](https://arenasproject.eu/).
